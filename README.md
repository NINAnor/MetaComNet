# MetaComNet
Repository for code related to the [MetaComNet](https://www.nina.no/english/Fields-of-research/Pollination) project funded by the Norwegian Research Council. The repository is organised according to the following directory structure:

* __HostPlantSDM__ A folder containing the code for the analysis and prediction of the locations of floral resources
  + __SPDEModelSDM__ A subfolder containing the code for an implementation of a spatial Gaussian Markov Random field parameteratisation of stochastic partial differential equations for host plant distribution modelling
  + __RandomForestSDM__ A subfolder containing the code for an implementation of a random forest models for host plant distribution modelling
* __PollinatorSDM__
